	Specifically, the problems of (1) minimizing total transmit power
	subject to signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints
	of each user and (2) SINR balancing subject to total transmit power
	constraints are considered. We propose a consensus-based distributed
	algorithm and the fast solution method via alternating the direction
	method of multipliers. First, we derive a distributed algorithm for
	minimization of total transmit power. Then, in conjunction with the
	bracketing method, a distributed algorithm for SINR balancing is
	derived. Numerical results show that the proposed distributed algorithms
	achieve the optimal centralized solution.},

  abstract = {We introduce a first-order method for solving very large convex cone
	programs. The method uses an operator splitting method, the alternating
	directions method of multipliers, to solve the homogeneous self-dual
	embedding, an equivalent feasibility problem involving finding a
	nonzero point in the intersection of a subspace and a cone. This
	approach has several favorable properties. Compared to interior-point
	methods, first-order methods scale to very large problems, at the
	cost of requiring more time to reach very high accuracy. Compared
	to other first-order methods for cone programs, our approach finds
	both primal and dual solutions when available or a certificate of
	infeasibility or unboundedness otherwise, is parameter free, and
	the per-iteration cost of the method is the same as applying a splitting
	method to the primal or dual alone. We discuss efficient implementation
	of the method in detail, including direct and indirect methods for
	computing projection onto the subspace, scaling the original problem
	data, and stopping criteria. We describe an open-source implementation,
	which handles the usual (symmetric) nonnegative, second-order, and
	semidefinite cones as well as the (non-self-dual) exponential and
	power cones and their duals. We report numerical results that show
	speedups over interior-point cone solvers for large problems, and
	scaling to very large general cone programs.},
